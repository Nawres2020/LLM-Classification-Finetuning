# LLM-Classification-Finetuning
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-classification-finetuning
This repository contains two approaches to solving a text classification problem in the context of a Kaggle competition focused on **LLM fine-tuning**. The competition aims to encourage participants to experiment with various strategies to optimize language models for specific downstream tasks, showcasing both performance improvements and practical trade-offs.

## Preprocessing
Effective text classification begins with robust data cleaning and preprocessing. The raw dataset provided in the competition required several steps to prepare it for modeling:

# 1. Data Cleaning
- Removing Noise: Eliminated irrelevant characters, stopwords, and punctuation to reduce noise.
- Lowercasing: Standardized the text by converting it to lowercase.
- Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens for further processing.
- Handling Missing Data: Addressed missing or incomplete entries by filling with placeholders or dropping records as appropriate.
# 2. Preprocessing
- TF-IDF Vectorization: Transformed the cleaned text into numerical representations using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), capturing the relative importance of words across the dataset.
- Feature Scaling: Normalized the feature space to ensure compatibility with machine learning models.
- Class Balancing: Addressed class imbalances through techniques like oversampling or weighted loss functions to ensure fair model training.
#3. Initial Modeling: Logistic Regression and SVM
- We trained Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models on the preprocessed text data to establish a baseline. These models were chosen for their simplicity and effectiveness in text  classification tasks. However, their performance metrics revealed clear limitations:

Accuracy: Approximately 0.4, highlighting the difficulty in capturing the complexity of the text dataset.
Insights: While TF-IDF provided a reasonable feature set, traditional models struggled to generalize well, especially on nuanced or contextually rich categories.
These initial experiments underscored the need for more advanced modeling techniques, prompting the exploration of LLM fine-tuning.



## Comparing BERT-Based and Non-BERT LLMs for Fine-Tuning in Text Classification

### The Problem and Context

In this competition, participants are tasked with fine-tuning a language model to classify text into predefined categories. Text classification is a cornerstone of natural language processing (NLP) applications, with use cases spanning sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization. 

The key focus is to explore how leveraging advanced models like **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** compares with simpler or baseline methods in terms of:
- Accuracy and performance metrics
- Training time and computational requirements
- Practical utility in real-world deployment

### Overview of the Approaches

#### 1. **Baseline Model (Without BERT)**

This approach utilizes a traditional language model without leveraging pre-trained transformer architectures like BERT. Key characteristics:
- Simpler preprocessing pipeline.
- Lower computational overhead.
- Basic fine-tuning performed with dense layers for classification.

#### 2. **BERT-Based Model**

This approach incorporates **BERT**, a state-of-the-art transformer architecture pre-trained on massive corpora. Key characteristics:
- Rich contextual embeddings that capture deeper semantic meanings.
- Fine-tuning performed with classification heads built on top of BERT.
- Requires more computational resources but promises higher performance.

### Comparison of Results

| Metric                   | Baseline Model (No BERT) | BERT-Based Model       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Accuracy**             | Moderate                | Significantly higher    |
| **Precision**            | Moderate                | High                    |
| **Recall**               | Moderate                | High                    |
| **F1-Score**             | Moderate                | High                    |
| **Training Time**        | Faster                  | Slower                  |
| **Computational Demand** | Low                     | High                    |

#### Key Observations:
1. **Performance Boost**: The BERT-based model consistently outperformed the baseline across all metrics, especially in capturing nuanced text representations for complex categories.
2. **Trade-Offs**: While the BERT-based approach delivers better results, it comes at the cost of increased training time and computational resources, making it less suitable for scenarios with limited infrastructure.
3. **Real-World Implications**: The choice between BERT and simpler models depends on the task's requirements. For high-stakes applications like sentiment analysis in sensitive domains, the performance gains from BERT justify its overhead.

### Conclusion

This comparison underscores the value of **BERT** in text classification tasks, particularly when high accuracy and robustness are priorities. However, the trade-offs in computational demand highlight the importance of aligning model selection with practical constraints.
